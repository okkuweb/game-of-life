# Notes
- [ ] Gotta make drawing logic and state logic separate. Now we're doing a bit of whatever everywhere and it's causing a bunch of extra draws for nothing when moving mouse over the play area
- [ ] Add UI which says play speed, pause/unpause, in the top left corner
- [ ] Make it so that map can be drawn even under the UI
